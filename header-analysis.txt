Notes: Original phishing-sample.txt is a sanitized plain-text sample and does NOT include raw RFC-822 headers (Received:, DKIM-Signature, etc.)

1) Current status
- Raw headers: NOT present in phishing-sample.txt
- .eml available: NO
- Action required to perform full header analysis: Obtain the raw message headers from the original email client (Gmail: Show original; Outlook: View message details; Thunderbird: View source) or save the message as .eml.

2) Recommended header analyzers (free)
- MX Toolbox Email Header Analyzer — https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx. Use to parse headers and examine Received chain and auth results.  
- Google Message header / Toolbox — https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/messageheader/ — good for quick analysis.  
- Microsoft / Message Header Analyzer variants — useful for Exchange/Office365 headers.

3) How to perform the analysis (steps to run when you have headers)
a. Copy full raw headers from the email client.
b. Paste into an analyzer (MX Toolbox or Google Message header).
c. Save the analyzer output (copy text or screenshot) to outputs/header-analyzer-output.txt or outputs/header-analyzer-screenshot.png.
d. Record key security results below (SPF/DKIM/DMARC + Received hops).

4) Example analysis (this is an illustrative example — replace with real results once you run the analyzer)
- SPF: fail  (example) — sending IP 203.0.113.45 not authorized in SPF for paypal.com.
- DKIM: none (example) — no DKIM-Signature header present for paypal.com.
- DMARC: policy = none; DMARC alignment = fail (example).
- Received-chain anomaly: Originating hop shows mail-from server mail.example.fake (country X) that is unrelated to paypal.com.
- Verdict (example): Authentication failed — message likely forged / spoofed.

5) Evidence saved (place real analyzer output here when available)
- outputs/header-analyzer-output.txt  (paste analyzer output here)
- outputs/header-analyzer-screenshot.png (optional screenshot)
