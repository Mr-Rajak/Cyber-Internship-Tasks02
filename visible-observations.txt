1) From / Display name
- Display name: "PayPal Support"
- Sender email address: support@paypa1.com
- Initial observation: Display name suggests PayPal; actual email domain is paypa1.com (uses the digit '1' instead of 'l') — suspicious.

2) To
- To: aman.rajak@example.test
- Observation: Message addressed to a specific test address; however greeting in body is generic ("Dear Customer") — inconsistent.

3) Subject
- Subject: Important: Suspicious activity on your account — Verify now
- Observation: Uses urgency and account security language to prompt action.

4) Date / Time
- Date: Mon, 23 Nov 2025 09:35:00 +0530
- Observation: Recent-sounding timestamp (for our test). Useful for header timeline when we analyze Received lines.

5) First lines of the body / Greeting
- First visible lines:
  
	"Dear Customer,
	We detected unusual activity on your PayPal account and, as a precaution, have limited access until you confirm your identity."

- Observation: Generic greeting (no real name); threatening/account-limiting language to force immediate action.

6) Links (visible vs actual)
- Displayed link text: https://www.paypal.com/verify
- Actual link (as shown in sample): http://paypal-secure.example.fake/verify?uid=Qw3xYz
- Observation: Visible link appears as official PayPal, but actual URL points to a suspicious domain (example.fake) and is HTTP not HTTPS (in sample) — strong phishing indicator.

7) Attachments
- Listed attachment: invoice_7921.zip
- Observation: ZIP file attached — compressed executables or archives are commonly used to hide malware. Never open.

8) Branding / signature
- Signature: "PayPal Account Security Team"
- Observation: Brand name used in display name and signature, but mismatch in sender domain and generic phrasing reduce trust.

9) Overall visible-field risk indicators (quick list)
- Display name / sender email mismatch (paypa1.com vs paypal.com).
- Generic greeting instead of personalized name.
- Urgent language with deadline ("24 hours").
- Visible vs actual link mismatch and non-secure scheme in sample.
- Suspicious attachment (invoice_7921.zip).
- Inconsistencies that suggest impersonation.
